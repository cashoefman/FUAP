# FUAP Performance Testing Guidelines

## Overview

Performance testing ensures that the FUAP application is responsive, reliable, and scalable, meeting defined performance criteria across various scenarios and user loads.

## Objectives

* Validate response times and overall responsiveness.
* Identify bottlenecks in authentication and profile-loading processes.
* Ensure scalability under expected user loads (e.g., concurrent logins).

## Testing Types

* **Load Testing:** Evaluate how the app handles increasing user counts.
* **Stress Testing:** Determine how the app behaves under peak and beyond-peak conditions.
* **Response Time Analysis:** Verify response times meet the expected benchmarks.

## Tools and Frameworks

* **Firebase Performance Monitoring:** Real-time insights and performance reporting.
* **XCTest (iOS):** Profiling and measuring response time for critical operations.
* **Android Profiler (Android):** Monitoring CPU, memory, and network performance using Android Studio.

## Initial Testing Scenarios

* User authentication response under normal and heavy load conditions.
* Profile data loading performance.
* Firebase read/write operations latency and throughput.

## Benchmark Criteria (Preliminary)

* Authentication and profile load time should be under 2 seconds.
* Stable performance for up to 500 concurrent active users initially.

## Reporting and Documentation

* Document performance test results clearly and comprehensively.
* Include observed metrics, identified bottlenecks, and recommended optimizations in the performance testing documentation.

## Continuous Monitoring

* Integrate Firebase Performance Monitoring into the CI/CD pipelines.
* Regularly review performance reports to proactively identify and address regressions.

These guidelines provide foundational directions to ensure robust performance standards in the FUAP project.
