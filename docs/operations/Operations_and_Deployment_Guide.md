# FUAP Operations and Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines operational and deployment procedures for the FUAP mobile application, ensuring efficient management, monitoring, and updates for both iOS and Android applications integrated with Firebase.

## Environment Overview

### Development Environment

* Purpose: For active development and integration testing.
* Managed locally on developer machines.

### Staging Environment

* Purpose: Final testing and validation before production.
* Separate Firebase project configured similarly to production for realistic testing.

### Production Environment

* Purpose: Live, user-facing environment.
* Firebase production instance with optimal performance and security settings.

## Deployment Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Checks

* All unit, integration, and performance tests pass.
* Peer-reviewed and approved pull requests.
* Complete Firebase configurations verified.

### Deployment Steps

#### iOS

1. Increment the app version in Xcode.
2. Archive the build via Xcode:

   * Select `Product > Archive`.
3. Distribute through TestFlight or App Store Connect:

   * Upload archive via Xcode organizer.

#### Android

1. Update app version and build numbers in `build.gradle`.
2. Generate release APK/AAB in Android Studio:

   * `Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK`.
3. Upload to Google Play Console for internal testing or production release.

### Post-Deployment Verification

* Verify deployments in TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Console (Android).
* Perform smoke tests to confirm core functionalities:

  * User authentication
  * Profile loading
  * Firebase integrations

## Rollback Procedure

* **iOS:** Use App Store Connect to revert to the previous app version.
* **Android:** Perform staged rollout rollbacks via Google Play Console.
* Monitor Firebase crash logs and error reporting for immediate issues post-rollback.

## Backup and Recovery

* Regularly back up Firestore data and user-generated content.
* Document clear recovery procedures, leveraging Firebase automated backups where possible.

## Monitoring and Alerts

* Utilize Firebase Performance Monitoring and Crashlytics.
* Set up alerts for critical issues, app crashes, and performance degradation.
* Monitor user activity and usage analytics to detect anomalies.

## Maintenance Tasks

* Regularly update project dependencies and Firebase SDKs.
* Perform routine security reviews and compliance checks (GDPR, CCPA).
* Schedule database cleanup and optimization tasks.

## Incident Management

* Document incident response process clearly.
* Define escalation paths and responsible stakeholders.
* Regular communication to stakeholders during incidents.

## Logging

* Utilize Firebase Crashlytics and Cloud Logging for centralized log management.
* Clearly outline how to access logs and interpret them for troubleshooting.

## Access Control

* Define strict user access and permissions in Firebase Console and development tools.
* Regularly audit and manage access credentials.

## Compliance and Security

* Adhere strictly to GDPR and CCPA regulations.
* Regularly audit security practices, Firebase rules, and data handling procedures.

## Troubleshooting

* Document common issues and resolutions:

  * Authentication issues
  * Firebase service interruptions
  * App crashes
* Clearly outline support procedures.

## Future Considerations

* Evaluate potential performance improvements regularly.
* Plan infrastructure scaling based on user growth and analytics.
* Continuous evaluation of Firebase services for cost-effectiveness and scalability.
