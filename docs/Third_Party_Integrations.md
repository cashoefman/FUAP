# FUAP API Documentation (Firebase-focused)

## Overview

Firebase provides the backend infrastructure for FUAP, managing Authentication, Firestore database, and potentially Cloud Functions.

## Firebase Project Configuration

* **Project ID:** \[Your Firebase Project ID]
* [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)

## Authentication APIs

### Methods

* Email/Password
* Magic Link authentication

### Example Scenarios

#### Login

* Endpoint interaction and authentication flow.

#### Registration

* Endpoint interaction for new user registrations.

#### Password Reset

* Endpoint for initiating password reset.

#### Email Verification

* Handling email verification processes.

### Magic Link Authentication

* Explanation of email magic link process.
* Callback handling for success and failure scenarios.

## Database (Firestore)

### Database Structure

* Collection and document schema.

### CRUD Operations Examples

#### User Profile

* Fetching, creating, updating, and deleting user profile data.

### Security Rules

* Detailed Firestore Security Rules documentation.

## Firebase Cloud Functions (if used)

### Cloud Function Endpoints

* HTTP triggers with URLs and payload examples.
* Background triggers (Firestore triggers, Authentication events).

### Cloud Functions Considerations

* **Performance & Scalability:**

  * Optimize function size and dependencies to reduce cold-start latency.
  * Clearly define and monitor execution times.
  * Keep logic simple and modular.

* **Security & Authorization:**

  * Secure HTTP endpoints using authentication and authorization.
  * Avoid embedding sensitive data; use environment variables or secure storage.

* **Error Handling & Logging:**

  * Implement standardized structured logging practices.
  * Provide descriptive error messages.

* **Cost Management:**

  * Monitor execution frequency and duration.
  * Regularly review usage through Firebase Console analytics.

* **Maintenance & Testing:**

  * Maintain comprehensive unit and integration tests.
  * Clearly document endpoints.

## Error Handling

* Standardized error handling across Firebase services.
* Common error codes with resolution guidance.

## Security and Rules

* Clear documentation of Firestore Security Rules.
* User permissions and data privacy management.

## Performance

* API performance expectations.
* Query optimizations.
* Information on rate limits (if applicable).

## Integration Best Practices

* Effective client-side integration examples in Swift and Kotlin.
* Recommendations on optimized data fetching for cost and latency reduction.

These guidelines and examples provide clarity and best practices for using Firebase services effectively within the FUAP project.
