## Repository Setup and Structure

### Step-by-Step Repository Initialization

1. **Establish Directory Structure**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/{architecture,api,testing,operations,releases,support,onboarding}
   mkdir src
   ```

2. **Scaffold Documentation and Essential Files**

   ```bash
   touch docs/Product_Requirements_Document.md \
         docs/Technical_Development_Plan.md \
         docs/architecture/Architecture_and_Design_Documentation.md \
         docs/api/API_Documentation.md \
         docs/testing/Testing_Documentation.md \
         docs/operations/Operations_and_Deployment_Guide.md \
         docs/releases/Release_Notes.md \
         docs/support/Support_and_Troubleshooting_Guides.md \
         docs/onboarding/Onboarding_Documentation.md \
         docs/Contribution_Guidelines.md \
         docs/Coding_Standards_and_Style_Guides.md \
         docs/Performance_Testing.md \
         docs/Third_Party_Integrations.md \
         LICENSE README.md .gitignore .gitattributes
   ```

3. **Create Repository on GitHub**

   * Log in to GitHub and create a new repository with a clear name.
   * Choose visibility settings (public/private).
   * Do **not** initialize with additional files (like README, `.gitignore`, or LICENSE) as these have been created locally.

4. **Link Local Repository to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
   git branch -M main
   ```

5. **Commit Initial Structure**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial repository setup with structured documentation"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

6. **Setup Branching Strategy**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b develop
   git push origin develop
   ```

## Recommended `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`

### `.gitignore`

```.gitignore
# macOS files
.DS_Store

# VSCode files
.vscode/

# Xcode files
build/
DerivedData/
*.xcuserstate
.swiftpm/

# Android files
.gradle/
/local.properties
/.idea/
/*.iml
/captures/
*.apk
*.aar
*.keystore

# General
*.log
.env

# Firebase
firebase-debug.log

# Node modules
node_modules/
```

### `.gitattributes`

```.gitattributes
* text=auto
*.md text
*.swift text
*.kt text
*.json text
```

## Development Lifecycle Practices

* **Version Control and Branching Strategy:** Git with Feature Branch Workflow.
* **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment:** Automate using preferred CI/CD tools.
* **Environment Management:** Clearly defined development, staging, and production environments.
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation, including setup and deployment instructions.
* **Issue Tracking:** Managed using GitHub Issues.
* **Code Reviews:** Mandatory peer reviews for all pull requests.
* **Dependency Management:** Regular audits and clear documentation of dependencies.
* **Security Reviews:** Regular audits and secure handling of sensitive data.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Utilize tools for real-time insights and proactive tracking.
* **Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups and disaster recovery procedures.
* **Compliance and Accessibility:** Adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and WCAG standards.

This plan provides a structured framework for the FUAP project's technical development lifecycle, ensuring quality, security, and maintainability.
